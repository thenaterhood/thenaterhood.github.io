# What is Net Neutrality?
Net Neutrality is one of the most important digital rights issues of our time. This is an issue that affects everyone - even those who do not work in the technology sector.

Net Neutrality is the idea that all data on the Internet, regardless of who it comes from, its political affiliation, company, or who’s consuming it, should be treated the same way and should move at the same speed.

Net neutrality is why you can find and access any information you want to. It is also why you can set up your own website (for yourself, for your business, or for anything else) for next to nothing, and still have it available to everyone online.

# Why Should I Care?
Net neutrality means that no matter what, you have the same access to information as everyone else. It also means that it's easy to make your own voice heard online no matter who you are or what your beliefs are.

Telecoms should not control what you can see - especially since they own their own media networks. Net neutrality makes sure they don't.

# How Can I Help Net Neutrality?
Remember! Be polite and respectful, but be assertive. Spamming or submitting lewd, racist, or otherwise immoral comments does not help the net neutrality cause.

## Contact the FCC
The FCC is required to take public feedback into account regarding their proposals. While the FCC may ignore you, this feedback can be used to support net neutrality in court.

### Add a filing to the FCC proceeding on net neutrality

#### First way (Pre-written letter):
1. Go <a target="_blank" href="https://dearfcc.org">here</a>
2. Fill out the form
3. Click "next" and follow the rest of the instructions

#### Second way (Do it yourself):

1. Go <a target="_blank" href="http://gofccyourself.com">here</a>
2. Click "+Express" towards the right of the page
3. Fill out the form. Say that the FCC must protect net neutrality and that strong Title II classification and enforcement of ISPs is important to you.
4. Click "Continue to Review Screen"
5. Click confirm

### Send a certified letter to the FCC
Certified mail is required to be signed for, meaning there is a record that it has been received. [Here's the address](200~https://www.google.com/search?q=Federal+Communications+Commission+Address&rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS733US733&oq=Federal+Communications+Commission+Address&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.6209j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)

### Call the FCC
Their phone number is 1 (888) 225-5322

## Contact your representative(s)

### Get in touch the old fashioned way
Tell them that net neutrality with strong Title II classification of ISPs is important to you. You can find who your representatives are
using your zipcode [on house.gov](http://www.house.gov/representatives/find/). Note that hand-written letters and phone calls make the most impact, but emails and faxes help make your voice heard too.

### Use ResistBot
Text "resist" to 50409, and a bot will guide you through finding your representatives and will send them a fax with your message on your behalf. This service is free, and you can use it as many times as you want.
