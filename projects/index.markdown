Projects I've Contributed To
----------------------------
* The Linux Kernel - submitted a patch that resolved an issue with generating device identifiers in the legacy AMD Lance Ethernet driver.
* [RIT Map](http://ritmap.github.io/) - a map of RIT's most interesting locations. Submitted locations, project suggestions, and a brief site design.
* [Browser Exploitation Framework (BEEF)](https://github.com/beefproject/beef) - Submitted a patch to the installer so a missing local configuration file could fall back onto a system one instead of failing.
