# Privacy Policy

This website collects information about your visit and what you do while during your visit. This policy describes how information collected from you or your device, or information that you provide, will be handled.

Last Updated 2017/02/25.

## Google Analytics

Like millions of other websites, this website uses a tracking service called Google Analytics for tracking statistical data about visitors.

Google Analytics records data such as:
* What website you came from to get here
* How long you visited
* What kind of device you're using
* What pages you visited
* Your general location (as accurate as the city you visited in)
* Your Internet Service Provider
* ...and a wide variety of other information

This data is used to understand what pages on this site are visited, what visitors are reading, as well as to improve the site based on common types of devices used (screen size, resolution, etc).

You can view the Google Analytics terms of service (which governs how the data collected by Google Analytics can be used) [here](https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html).

#### Opt Out:
You can use a browser extension to block this type of tracking, such as [Google Analytics Opt-out](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en), Ghostery, uBlock, or others (this is not an endorsement or an implication of any security or features of the listed plugins).

## Cookies

Third-party services, such as Google Analytics, used by this site may store something called "cookies" on your device. "Cookies" are small pieces of information sent to your browser and stored on your device, and reported back to the website when you load pages.

Data stored in cookies can include anonymised data about your visit such as how you use the site, the URL of the website you came from if you clicked on a link to get to this website, your IP address, and how often and for how long you use the site. Cookies expire after varying periods of time.

Specifically, cookies used by this site are:
* Google Analytics

#### Opt Out:
Using your browser's options, you are free to delete these cookies or block them entirely at any time. 


## Blog Subscriptions (Including Email Addresses)

Like many blogs, you are free to provide your email address in order to receive notifications of new blog posts or other news. This feature is provided by a third-party service, Google FeedBurner.

If you request an email subscription, your email address, subscription date, and subscription status (whether you've confirmed your subscription and whether your email address is still active) are made available to me and stored in the FeedBurner service. This data is never shared or sold by me.

If this site migrates to a different subscription service, your email address may be downloaded and imported into the new service, but will not be retained unencrypted anywhere outside the service(s) longer than necessary. This may be done without notice, but changes will be noted in this privacy policy.

Google FeedBurner also tracks various metrics about use of the RSS/ATOM feed it re-publishes from this site including types of feed readers used, items clicked on, number of subscribers, and various other information.

#### Opt Out:
Don't provide your email address to be added to the mailing list. You may also change your mind and ignore the confirmation email (you will receive no further emails, but your email address will be retained) or unsubscribe at any time with the instructions at the bottom of any email from this site or FeedBurner.

## Other Information

Additional information may be collected by webserver logs or other logs on the server this site runs on. This information may include your IP address, the page(s) you visited, and when you visited them. This information does not contain personal details.

This information is not shared, but is used to take proactive measures to ensure the security and stability of the website, and may be used to gather aggregate metrics about site traffic.

#### Opt Out:
You cannot opt out.
