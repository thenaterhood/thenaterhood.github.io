The issues with the exposed email accounts have been far more widespread
than previously thought. As the investigation continues, it appears that
accounts for **Windows Live, Yahoo, Google, AOL, EarthLink, and
Comcast** have been affected. Details for the affected accounts were
posted online but have been taken down by request of the affected sites.

However, it seems that if you have any of those services, you should not
start to worry about your privacy. Yahoo, Google, and Microsoft (Windows
Live) have confirmed that all of the stolen accounts are real, but that
they were compromised as a result of phishing attacks. This means that
the account compromises were NOT resulting from internal security
problems.

Security experts who are investigating say that the accounts were
probably posted online NOT for data theft but instead to make a point to
users about phishing attacks, which many people aren't well aware of.
The specific order (alphabetical, it would seem) that the information
was posted in seems to indicate that the attackers had been harvesting
the information with the intent of posting it online. (1)

It is highly advisable to change any passwords and security
questions/answers that you use on any of the affected sites, especially
if you click links in emails or use your account to access other online
services.
