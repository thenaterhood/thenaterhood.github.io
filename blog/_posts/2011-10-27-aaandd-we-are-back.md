Just a quick note before any real posts go up!

Since I'm now a college student at RIT, time is a little bit limited
between classes and the rest of my life, but I haven't forgotten about
anything.  So, excuse my extremely erratic posting- college, much to the
disappointment of my readers, does actually have more importance than my
blog.

With that said, there are some new posts coming up soon, so stay tuned. 
If you're new, welcome!  Stick around, it's worth it!
