title: The Internet Speaks Up About SOPA

<p>Anyone looking to quickly look something up on Wikipedia, flip through Reddit, or grab a quick read from the front page of Wordpress today will be sorely disappointed.&nbsp; Those, among with many other sites are currently working to educate users about the dangers that SOPA and PIPA would bring if passed.</p>
<p>On the surface, the two bills are looking to solve the huge issue of Internet piracy.&nbsp; However, much removed from that, the ramifications of them would be felt globally, destroying an open Internet all around the world.&nbsp; Both bills have one thing in common: censorship.&nbsp; They would permit the U.S government to take down any website - and by take down I mean take down and make it completely non-existent in the U.S - on small copyright claims.&nbsp; Both bills have support from the MPAA as well as other huge corporations who are willing to pay for senators to vote in favour of it.</p>
<p>SOPA/PIPA (Stop Online Privacy Act and Protect IP Act) will be voted on on January 24th, 2012.&nbsp; If passed, they would allow the U.S. to censor the Internet, pave the way for other countries to pass similar laws, and destroy the security and neutrality of the Internet.&nbsp; If passed, the world as we know it could end in 2012, just as the Mayan calendar predicts.&nbsp; Call, email, or send a letter to your senator and make sure they know you oppose SOPA/PIPA to keep the Internet an open place and to preserve freedom of speech around the world.</p>
<p>This is big enough that Wikipedia, Reddit, Cheezburger, and other huge online presences are willing to go dark for it, and others considered doing the same (Google, Amazon, Microsoft...).&nbsp; This is a big deal- speak up and don't let the Internet go dark.</p>
