The Internet gives everyone access to a platform through which they can share their views and make their voices heard. More than half of Americans use the Internet as their primary source of information, which highlights how important it is for people to be able to make their voices heard online. With [over 1.2 billion people sharing their voices on Facebook](http://newsroom.fb.com/company-info/) - not to mention other social networks and websites - it's clear that the Internet has made that more possible than ever before. However, access to the Internet is provided by an industry with a near monopoly on providing Internet service, [who claim their own rights to free speech](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/10/net-neutrality-violates-the-first-amendment-according-to-one-isp/) when it comes to deciding what their customers have access to.

Service providers have in the past claimed - and some still claim - that [control over what their customers see is their First Amendment right](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/10/net-neutrality-violates-the-first-amendment-according-to-one-isp/). Specifically, in a brief filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals, one of the Internet providers that still makes this claim says that Net Neutrality prevents them from favoring their own websites over other websites. This much is true and is the point of a neutral Internet; Net Neutrality requires Internet providers to deliver all websites at the same speed, the same way. That's important because Internet providers are huge companies who frequently own their own media outlets. Whether the website is theirs, as large as Facebook, or a small site from you or me, it will be treated the same way. As more communication moves to the digital world, ensuring that the same ideas that can be expressed in the physical world can be expressed without suppression on the Internet is extremely important.

If a site lacks the funding to pay for their service to be part of the open Internet or an Internet fast lane, that service may be doomed to fail. Research from Microsoft [suggests that slowing down a website by 250ms (the blink of an eye) makes users more likely to use a competitor](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/01/technology/impatient-web-users-flee-slow-loading-sites.html). What that means for the owner of a small business or a personal website who can't pay to be in one of the so-called "fast lanes" is much more difficulty in keeping visitors. Large companies like Walmart, Facebook, etc would pay the fees to be carried in those fast lanes which right away makes their voice stronger than those not in a fast lane. Companies such as Netflix [already pay for access to Internet fast lanes](https://media.netflix.com/en/company-blog/how-netflix-works-with-isps-around-the-globe-to-deliver-a-great-viewing-experience) by putting their servers directly on Internet providers' networks. Your voice, and the voice of your local community could easily be droned out by even minuscule differences in speed.

On a more individual level, [a non-neutral Internet takes away your power to choose what voices you listen to](https://www.pri.org/stories/2014-06-16/net-neutrality-and-first-amendment-who-has-right-free-speech). Internet service providers are for-profit companies whose goal is to maximize their already astronomical profits. By discouraging people from accessing sites - through the use of data caps, by slowing down websites even minutely, or through tiered service plans, service providers take control of what people are able to see. The vast majority of Internet subscribers in the U.S. have access to only one or two Internet providers, so generally speaking there is no competition to prevent that from happening. The complaint that huge businesses are driving out local shops then comes to the Internet as well, which in a neutral Internet is less likely.

Through net neutrality rules and regulation, we can keep the Internet an even playing field where [all data and views are treated equally](http://www.cjfe.org/net_neutrality_a_free_internet_protects_free_speech). Internet service providers, who are major information providers all over the world, should not be gatekeepers to being heard online. The fact that an information provider would argue that they should be able to provide an editorialized version of the Internet is concerning, particularly when many of them own media outlets. [We have had this discussion before with cable TV which due to legislation is not neutral](http://www.cnn.com/2010/OPINION/08/05/franken.net.neutrality/). That means television carriers (cable providers) can drop networks that aren't willing to pay their fees - [as recently happened with a state news network in Connecticut](http://www.wfsb.com/story/34254991/optimum-from-altice-drops-wfsb), and that independent producers are almost entirely blocked from being shown on cable. Without protecting net neutrality, the same could happen online. The Internet is, for the most part, neutral so it is hard to imagine an Internet that isn't. If we don't fight for it to stay that way now, we may find out exactly what a non-neutral Internet is like in the not so far future - one where startups and independent creators are shut out and large companies rule.
