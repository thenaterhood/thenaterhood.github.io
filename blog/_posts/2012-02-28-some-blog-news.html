<p><i>The Philosophy of Nate</i> has lived on a Blogger subdomain ever since I first started it as a non-public blog. Since then it has gone through a number of changes and eventually evolved into the globally syndicated blog that it is now.</p>
<p>At this point in time it seems appropriate that <i>The Philosophy of Nate</i> should move to its own web address and fully become its own online entity.&nbsp; I actually made the switch from a Blogger domain a few weeks ago, for anyone who noticed, but now it's time to make the official announcement!&nbsp; For the time being, the old address, natesphilosophy.blogspot.com, will still get you here without any trouble.&nbsp; However, the shiny new address is blog.thenaterhood.com so be sure to update your bookmarks.</p>
<p>This also means a change in the email address that all you email subscribers receive mail from, which is currently my private mailbox.&nbsp; Starting next week you'll see mail from our shiny new email address, blog [at] thenaterhood.com. Make sure to update your email settings so that email from <i>The Philosophy of Nate</i> doesn't get marked as spam. <b>There will be no changes to the email subscription service other than the address.</b></p>
<p>As always, happy reading! New to <i>The Philosophy of Nate?</i><b> </b>Welcome! You might want to go grab our feed or subscribe by email over in the sidebar so you don't miss anything good.</p>
