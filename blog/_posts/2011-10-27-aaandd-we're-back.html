<p>Just a quick note before any real posts go up!</p>
<p>Since I'm now a college student at RIT, time is a little bit limited between classes and the rest of my life, but I haven't forgotten about anything.&nbsp; So, excuse my extremely erratic posting- college, much to the disappointment of my readers, does actually have more importance than my blog.</p>
<p>With that said, there are some new posts coming up soon, so stay tuned.&nbsp; If you're new, welcome!&nbsp; Stick around, it's worth it!</p>
