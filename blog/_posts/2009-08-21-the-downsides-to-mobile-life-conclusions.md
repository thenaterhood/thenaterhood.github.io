As the Internet grows and more devices gain the ability to connect to
it, our online presence grows. As mentioned in earlier posts in this
series, there are significant downsides to being constantly connected or
addicted to the Internet.

However, that's not to say that it's all bad or that we should turn to
older means of communication (snail mail, anyone?). Being online has
some distinct benefits providing one does not sit in front of their
computer 24/7 or has a cell phone implanted in their molars
(<http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2002/06/53302>) so they
don't miss a single thing when not on a computer.

Being online everywhere opens up a whole new world of information, quite
literally. Information about nearly anything (and anyone, as it would
seem) is right at the fingertips of anyone with access to the Internet,
whether that information is about something right next to them or across
the world. Such information can aid in making healthy decisions, staying
safe, keeping up with local events, and even the more personal, keeping
up with family happenings.

In order to make the best of online life, it's best to stay aware of the
potential dangers and to use it in moderation (I could make that my blog
catchphrase I say it so much). Keep in touch with the physical world and
communicate face-to-face, for starters- that's what the human mind was
made for. In addition;

-   Look away from the computer/phone screen at something around 20 feet
    away every 20 minutes to prevent eyestrain.
-   Get outside and go for a walk to take a break and get some exercise.
-   If you're addicted to it, get help from a counselor or family to
    break it and get your life back.

Living online, whether constantly or sporadically is a lifestyle choice
and requires some decisions on the part of the user in order to fit it
into their life and where they will be connected. Despite the bad, I
spend a lot of time online and I'm aware of it and choose to live that
way. There's nothing wrong with it unless it becomes an actual problem.

Enjoy the Internet, but use it wisely with an eye towards the negative
effects of an online lifestyle.
