2009 has come and gone and being the day before New Years Eve it seems
like an appropriate time to look back at some of the more interesting
posts of the year (if my tracking is any indication of
interestingness).The most popular by far were the ones regarding
personal and online information:

[Do You Know Where you
Are?](http://natesphilosophy.blogspot.com/2009/10/do-you-know-where-you-are.html)

-   A post about the extent of sites that personal information can
    spread to across the Internet.

[Where on Earth is Your
Data?](http://natesphilosophy.blogspot.com/2009/12/where-on-earth-is-your-data.html)

-   Where in the world (literally!) your personal information could
    reside.

Next up, the most searched for:

    Networking](http://natesphilosophy.blogspot.com/2009/03/social-networking-good-and-bad.html)

celebrate.
