Facebook will be making some changes to the way its users control who
can see their information within the next few weeks, which include
changes to the privacy pages and networks.

The first plans for Facebook's new privacy system is to remove regional
networks.  As Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg notes, networks worked
well for privacy before the site had millions of users; in the beginning
the user base was mainly students, so each school had its own network. 
From then, networks have expanded to engulf entire regions in some
cases.  The vastness of these networks makes them unusable from the
standpoint of using networks to control privacy.

In addition to the removal of regional networks, a new set of privacy
controls will be introduced which, according to the post on Facebook,
will allow for more fine-grained control. 

Of course, with the introduction of a new system for privacy, your
current settings will need to replicated on the new controls.  Facebook
promises to suggest new settings based on each user's current settings
but they also recommend reading over the new options in order to ensure
that your permissions remain the same and so that you can take advantage
of the new options.

> ...*the best way for you to find the right settings is to read through

As always, all users will be notified of the changes as they're rolled
out.
