Admittedly I haven't been using YIID for too long so I can only give a
general overview of the main features. YIID strikes me as your standard
modern OpenID provider.

-   **Integration of other IDs.** YIID allows you to make an account
    with a different OpenID or Hotmail or Facebook account, which makes
    a lot of sense.
-   **Contacts.** YIID provides a contact list that you can add contacts
    to. In addition, you can import contacts from a few other sites or
    upload a contacts file (vCard) from your computer.
-   **Multiple Identities.** As with most providers, YIID allows you to
    set up separate IDs and choose the one you'd like to use when you
    sign up for a site.
-   **Twitter Integration.** Not all providers currently support this
    and possibly never will, but YIID allows not only logging in via
    twitter, but also tweeting from the YIID site, which makes some
    sense given the next point;
-   **Networking.** YIID follows with some of the newer OpenID providers
    in that it also provides social networking features such as friends
    and status updates.

Since I haven't been using YIID too extensively, I can't vouch for it in
either direction particularly well. It is similar to Chi.mp in regards
to features, but does have some fewer features from what I can see. The
URL (and feel free to visit it, it has an Identity page like others)
looks like [http://TheNaterhood.yiid.com](http://thenaterhood.yiid.com/)

It should also be noted that the site seems to be German based, so some
of the labels and headings on the site are written in German.
