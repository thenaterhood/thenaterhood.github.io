I was forced to take a brief hiatus from keeping the blog up to date
once spring quarter hit at school due to the workload.  As I have
mentioned in the past, school takes precedence over writing for *The
Philosophy of Nate* as it should, so posting will be irregular.  Despite
the blog's constipation lately, some work has been going on behind the
scenes just as slowly to get everything in working order across the
website, and plans are in order to actually get some things on it.

Now that spring quarter is over, posting will be much more regular, time
permitting.  There are already some posts lined up for the near future,
so stay tuned.  If you've stuck around to put up with the weird posting
schedule of *The Philosophy of Nate*, you won't be disappointed; your
usual stream of content will be coming your way.  If you're new,
welcome! Stick around, it's worth it!
