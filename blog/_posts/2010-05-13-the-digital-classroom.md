Slowly and steadily technology has been trickling into the classroom,
starting with calculators and slowly growing to more complex equipment.
Schools have, for a fair amount of time, featured computer labs for
students and later, computers in classrooms for teacher use with grading
software.

In all honesty, the Internet is best kept away from the main part of the
curriculum in schools. With the negative side of the Internet forgotten
\[for the moment\] and we forget all the issues with porn and such-
which students will always find a way to look at in school despite the
best efforts of administrators- there's simply nothing inherently
necessary about bringing the Internet to the classroom.

Society is changing and does focus around the use of a computer or cell
phone or other connected gadget- it's getting harder to stay away from
everything (and everyone). Writing with a pencil is starting to fade out
as typing takes over, for example- even in schools. I took the SAT a few
weeks ago and only a handful of my friends taking it knew how to write
in cursive for the certification statement. In our school district,
typing lessons start in elementary school and teachers encourage
students to type, rather than write, assignments. The more we bring the
Internet and therefore computers into academics, skills will vanish-
writing becomes obsolete, mental math is forgotten (where it hasn't been
already), figuring things out is no longer necessary. Load up a web
browser and someone else already figured it out.

That's not even taking into account the distractions- computers and the
Internet have games, and students will always be able to get around any
blocks set up by system administrators. Each student may have a world of
opportunities on his or her desk in the form of a laptop- but they're
more likely to take advantage of the world of distractions to escape the
day's boring lecture.
