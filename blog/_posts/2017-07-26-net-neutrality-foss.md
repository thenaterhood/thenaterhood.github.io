The net neutrality discussion is, at its core, about free speech on the Internet. Free speech online is a driving force for the online community, providing a platform for [an average of over 1.2 billion people per day shared their voices on Facebook alone](http://newsroom.fb.com/company-info/) in March 2017, as well as other communities. It's possible to be heard as well, with more than half of Americans using the Internet as their primary source of information. Unfortunately, ISPs want their own say in how free speech actually is online, with some [claiming their own rights to free speech](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/10/net-neutrality-violates-the-first-amendment-according-to-one-isp/) when it comes to what people can access.

ISPs are serious about their free speech claims when it comes to net neutrality. Several ISPs and telecom associations have filed briefs with the U.S. Court of Appeals arguing that net neutrality prevents them from favoring their own services in order to send their own message. The idea of a telecom exerting editorial control over what parts of the Internet can be accessed is deeply concerning. ISPs aren't wrong in that part of their brief, however, because net neutrality does require ISPs to deliver all websites the same way, without any sort of paid prioritization or throttling. This is important not only because ISPs are a gateway to information, but because a lot of them happen to own their own media outlets. Violating net neutrality gives ISPs control over who can be heard, what can be accessed, and potentially, what opinions can be held. Doing so isn't necessarily obvious. Research from Microsoft [suggests that slowing down a website by just 250ms (the blink of an eye) makes users more likely to use a competing service](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/01/technology/impatient-web-users-flee-slow-loading-sites.html), even though the speed difference is too small for humans to be consciously aware of.

Such things could change the open source landscape drastically. Although open source software powers much of the modern world, [with 78% of companies reporting they ran open-source software in 2015](http://www.zdnet.com/article/its-an-open-source-world-78-percent-of-companies-run-open-source-software/), that doesn't mean projects won't feel the effects of a more restricted Internet. While larger organizations such as the Apache Foundation, Mozilla, or others might fare okay in a world without net neutrality, smaller projects could be droned out by ISP restrictions. Even those larger open source communities might find themselves becoming niche if they're overshadowed by larger companies that are able to afford to sponsor data or to exist in faster tiers. This could cause companies or individuals that would be otherwise willing to support a FOSS option to choose a proprietary option due to better access. Zero-rating, ISP agreements, and throttling are already making this a possibility, with [a big-name ISP recently caught throttling Netflix](https://www.techdirt.com/blog/netneutrality/articles/20170722/03252237838/verizon-throttles-netflix-subscribers-test-it-doesnt-inform-customers-about.shtml), and Netflix [making agreements with ISPs to place servers on their networks for better performance](https://openconnect.netflix.com/en/). It's much harder to argue for open-source options when they come with an extra toll. This works in the reverse direction also, by making it harder to make meaningful open source contributions due to worse access, restricted reference materials, and limited data. Lack of competition in the ISP market may mean that for most, a more FOSS-friendly option doesn't exist.

The good news is that the open source community can support net neutrality and alternate options for accessing the Internet. Projects such as TOR, VPN technologies, and proxies make it harder for ISPs to track and restrict Internet traffic, though they don't avoid data caps. Other projects, such as community-developed mesh networks or municipal internet can provide more options for accessing the Internet unrestricted. Successful municipal networks have been developed around the country, with [at least 500 communities in the U.S. providing one as of June 2017](https://muninetworks.org/communitymap), including the often-cited Chattanooga, Tennessee network. Community-owned mesh networks such as [PittMesh in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania](http://www.pittmesh.net/) or [Commotion](https://commotionwireless.net/about/) could operate on a wide scale with enough participants. Should net neutrality be overturned, these projects may be an essential part of getting online.

This isn't the first time we've had a discussion about net neutrality. The breakup of the Bell telephone monopoly was one major net neutrality battle that was fought and won, resulting in Title II and the phone network we're accustomed to today. Cable TV was a net neutrality battle that was lost, giving us the cable networks—and their ability to drop networks that don't agree to their terms—that we rely on today. With strong net neutrality regulations and alternate options for accessing the web, the Internet can stay a place where [freedom of speech reigns](http://www.cjfe.org/net_neutrality_a_free_internet_protects_free_speech). If we don't fight for net neutrality now, we'll see online communities shrink, fewer choices, and less ability to make ourselves heard.
