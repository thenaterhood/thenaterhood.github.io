Of the
OpenID providers I reviewed (see the posts in their full glory: 
[Chi.mp](http://natesphilosophy.blogspot.com/2009/10/reviews-of-openid-chimp.html),
[Verisign Personal Identity
Portal](http://natesphilosophy.blogspot.com/2009/11/reviews-of-openid-verisign-personal.html)
\[and an
[Update](http://natesphilosophy.blogspot.com/2009/11/verisign-personal-identity-portal-some.html)\],
[Your Internet ID
(YIID)](http://natesphilosophy.blogspot.com/2009/11/reviews-of-openid-your-internet-id-yiid.html),
[MyOpenID](http://natesphilosophy.blogspot.com/2009/11/reviews-of-openid-myopenid.html)),
here's my opinion on them (one being best, four being the worst)

Options/Features

Ease of Use/Simplicity

2.  YIID
3.  Verisign PIP
4.  Chi.mp

It is worth noting that the available features (a lot vs very few)
directly affects the ease of use as more features take more time to
learn.  As for the trustworthiness, it's based mainly on reputation-
Verisign is known for providing security certificates to sites and
offers a multitude of verification options.

My personal favorite is Chi.mp because in addition to providing an
identity it gives users their own home on the Internet with its own
domain name and importable content.  This may not influence those who
already have a web site (and who can, by the way, use it as an OpenID
URL), but for those who are strewn across the Internet across many
networks, it pulls them all together.
