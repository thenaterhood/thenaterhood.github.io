The world of computing has come a long way in the area of usability.
It's possible for anyone to pick up a device and find their way around
it because of clean graphical user interfaces. Don't get me wrong, it's
a great thing that makes the Internet accessible to everyone no matter
of age. The problem is that this is moving a large part of the
population to the point where they are computer illiterate, with little
to no understanding of how to fix or how to manage their own computers.
As we collectively decide to delegate the duties of maintaining and
building devices to the IT departments and engineers - who many think
rather low of - we start to remove the understanding of how to manage an
increasingly computerized world from policy makers.

As we move to more accessible computers, we start to introduce kids to
technology at younger and younger ages, it's easy to lead ourselves to
believe that kids are getting increasingly computer literate. While we
are giving kids access to a wealth of information and are acclimating
them to using technology, we are not promoting any kind of computer
literacy. Using a computer is becoming a skill nearly ubiquitous as
knowing how to speak, but as with knowing how to speak not involving any
particular amount of literacy, knowing how to navigate through menus
doesn't make one computer literate. Instead of pushing for skills on how
to manage a computer we delegate all of the "hard" tasks that we would
rather not understand to the lowly IT department and engineers,
effectively taking control of our data out of our own hands. We're
creating a generation of people who understand technology less than the
alleged "technologically illiterate" older generation which is nothing
short of downright dangerous when it comes to a new generation of people
writing policies and managing companies. We're losing control of our
data and our technology as we remove ourselves from it.

We need to fix the problem before we lose control of our own devices as
they get increasingly locked down and we're no longer able to manage
them. For some, that may seem appealing, but it isn't a bright future
when our data and the abilities of the things we use are entirely at the
mercy of the computer shop down the street or the IT department in the
basement, or the policymakers governing what we are allowed to do with
them. Already we see problems with this with attempted policies like
SOPA and CISPA trying to take what we are allowed to see out of our
hands.

To prevent this, we need to put aside the irrational fear of knowing how
our devices work under the hood. We need to look at the under the hood
as another place for our kids to explore, whether or not we understand
it ourselves. There's a whole world to be explored beyond the safety of
Microsoft and Apple with a lot of exciting things to discover. Linux is
free, the source code is feely and legally available, and a number of
projects are open to people looking to learn and contribute. Languages
like Python are free, easy to learn, and easy to develop in.

Projects such as the Raspberry Pi are a great place for anyone willing
to learn to dive into learning Linux and how to make a device do
anything, limited only by your imagination. We need to put aside our
irrational fear of letting our kids explore a place safer than the
Internet that lies behind every device we use and broaden our horizens
to become computer literate again. Take it from a software engineer - it
can be intimidating, but it's an important skill. We need to stop
allowing kids to just use their devices but to push them to explore
further than 'liking' and 'following.'
