title: Taking Time Off From Software Engineering

A lot of us in the software field live, breathe, and even dream software. We love what we do so we surround ourselves
with it; we join massive groups of software engineers where we constantly ask for critiques of our websites and
resumes and show off our new thing we’re building from something new we’re learning that we’re sure is going to change
the world while we flaunt our startup ideas because we want to create the next big thing but often we put things on
hold “to come back to” (except we never get back to them) to play with the new new thing so we don’t fall behind while
the live stream of someone programming or the most recent Hackathon sits on our second screen so we can learn something
else new or to look at the latest high stakes in competitive coding then we get home from work or school and
immediately dive into our personal software scene so we don’t miss a beat while we’re awake and later we get woken up
at 3AM by our phone because someone we once talked to online a year ago started a company and wants to hire us and in
the morning we wake up to swim through emails of bug reports and feature requests on a project we built that someone
noticed and now a bunch of people use.

That paragraph was one long sentence with little punctuation so you’re probably out of breath. Take a breath.

One more for good measure.

That’s what it sometimes feels like to be involved in software. Don’t get me wrong, we love every second of it.
Software engineering isn’t an easy discipline as it’s a mashup of tech and creativity and that’s what makes it
interesting. Unfortunately, it’s easy to get so invested that we start to take it for granted and to forget that
there’s a life away from the screen. If we’re not careful, we can start to burn out as we software becomes just
something we do, rather than something we enjoy doing.

Admittedly, software is difficult to take a break from. As software engineers, we create things that are used
everywhere; we go about our day and immediately notice when software could be written better. We notice when it
takes the clerk ten taps to put in our two item order and we notice the weird hoops our web banking forces us
through to log in. It sometimes takes a conscious effort to say “No. I don’t need to work on this problem right
now.”

If we don’t slow down and take some time to look at the bigger world, we start to burn out. We forget we still need
to experience the bigger world that we’re trying to improve if we want to continue to improve it. Even worse, we
start taking our engineering world for granted. When that happens, we start to feel jaded and we forget our
enthusiasm for what we do. We need to take time to breathe so we can remind ourselves why we enjoy software, notice
the new things we can fix, and rest our fingers.
