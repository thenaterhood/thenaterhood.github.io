Mastering a technology is worthwhile when it provides us with a way of performing tasks efficiently. In the ever-speedy tech industry, being able to churn out quality work quickly is considered a virtue. Through repeated use, we eventually learn all the ins and outs of the technology we use. It develops into a comfortable thing to work with so we use it frequently.

Unfortunately, it's easy to get "stuck" on the technology we master. While there isn't anything wrong with having a technology preference, by not branching out to learn other things we can cause our skills to plateau. Our preferred tool is a shining beacon of perfection that can solve any problem (including those that maybe it can't). It becomes hard to pick up new skills when learning a new tool amounts to wrestling with a new technology for hours, versus finishing the task in a few minutes with the tool we're most comfortable with. Worse still, it can be tempting to resort to intellectual violence when a technical choice needs to be made, if the conversation is allowed to happen at all. Pushing for a specific technology without consideration is not forward thinking.

Continuining to push the boundaries of what we know and what we're comfortable with helps us become better engineers. While our preferred choice of technology may work well, it may not always be the best option, something that needs to be considered. Sometimes, by trying new things, we can even find a new favorite once the dust settles from going at it with something new for a while.

Most importantly, by trying a new tool we get a new perspective of the one we continue to use. Even if the new thing we're working with isn't the best fit for the job or if we continue to hate it, we go back to our comfort zone with some new perspectives. Maybe the way we do something is done differently in the other tool happens to inspire us to improve our own way. Technology changes quickly so we need to be able to adapt just as quickly to changes in the tool we're comfortable with as well as to be ready for the next evolution of tools that may come our way.
