In any field, people tend to gravitate towards a specialty. Due to the nature of humans to find familiar things comfortable, we’ll find a technology or a method that we like and we’ll continue to use it. Through frequent use, we learn more about it and we achieve a high level of efficiency in using it. In the field of software, this can be a particular language or family of languages, a particular technology, a certain framework, or maybe a specific development tool. Due to personal preference or due to where we work, we’ll eventually pick up a specialty even if we don’t intend to simply due to repeated use.

Specialties are worth developing — intentionally or not — because they mean we’re particularly good at something that we do. It means we’ve mastered — more or less — something we work with frequently. However, it can also lead to a very myopic view of the world. Rather than looking at new technologies and further honing skills, we can start to develop an unhealthy arrogance around our specialty and our skills can start to plateau.

Unfortunately, specialties are as easy to get “stuck in” so to speak, as they are to pick up when you’re looking the other way. If we aren’t careful, our choice of specialty becomes a shining beacon of perfection which can solve any problem. We get so efficient at using its strengths and working around its quirks we find it hard to try something new because of the resulting frustration. We end up fighting with the new tool or wrestling with the new language while we try to tackle its learning curve and wondering why the new pursuit is a good idea over just using our tried and true knowledge. Worse, when situations arise where a decision needs to be made, it can lead to intellectual violence and an inability to examine other options objectively.

Pushing the boundaries of what we know and are comfortable with helps us better understand what we already know while also picking up something new. We may find a better tool for the job — or a better tool for a future job. Continuing to learn also keeps our ability to learn from getting rusty so that as we need to hone new skills, within our specialty or not, doing so remains easy. In the technology world, continuing to learn is paramount so that we don’t get left behind as everything, including our mastery, continues to evolve in ways we aren’t always expecting.
