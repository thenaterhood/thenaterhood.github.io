title: The Internet Speaks Up About SOPA

Anyone looking to quickly look something up on Wikipedia, flip through
Reddit, or grab a quick read from the front page of Wordpress today will
be sorely disappointed.  Those, among with many other sites are
currently working to educate users about the dangers that SOPA and PIPA
would bring if passed.

On the surface, the two bills are looking to solve the huge issue of
Internet piracy.  However, much removed from that, the ramifications of
them would be felt globally, destroying an open Internet all around the
world.  Both bills have one thing in common: censorship.  They would
permit the U.S government to take down any website - and by take down I
mean take down and make it completely non-existent in the U.S - on small
copyright claims.  Both bills have support from the MPAA as well as
other huge corporations who are willing to pay for senators to vote in
favour of it.

SOPA/PIPA (Stop Online Privacy Act and Protect IP Act) will be voted on
on January 24th, 2012.  If passed, they would allow the U.S. to censor
the Internet, pave the way for other countries to pass similar laws, and
destroy the security and neutrality of the Internet.  If passed, the
world as we know it could end in 2012, just as the Mayan calendar
predicts.  Call, email, or send a letter to your senator and make sure
they know you oppose SOPA/PIPA to keep the Internet an open place and to
preserve freedom of speech around the world.

This is big enough that Wikipedia, Reddit, Cheezburger, and other huge
online presences are willing to go dark for it, and others considered
doing the same (Google, Amazon, Microsoft...).  This is a big deal-
speak up and don't let the Internet go dark.
