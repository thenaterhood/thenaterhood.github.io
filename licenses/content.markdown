## Why is your work licensed instead of copyrighted?

Work licensed under Creative Commons licenses is still copyrighted. Violations of the license constitute copyright infringement.

Free culture licenses are intended to encourage the sharing of knowledge and culture in ways that allow it to be freely shared and built on.
