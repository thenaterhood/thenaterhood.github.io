# Who am I?

I'm a software engineer. In layman's terms, that means I enjoy writing code,
designing software, and generally making cool ideas into nifty applications.

Since I was young, I've had a strong appreciation for technology. I looked in
awe at the things that were built around me and wanted to know how they worked.
I could spot a burnt out bulb on a string of lights in seconds, and was more
concerned about how things worked than I was concerned about why I was there.
That same passion and curiosity followed me to the world of software where I
find being involved with building better and more powerful software incredibly
exciting.

Offline, I run long distance, explore the outdoors, and enjoy picking up new
skills through a variety of side projects. If thereâ€™s something new I can
learn, I want to learn it.
