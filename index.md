# Who am I?

I'm a software engineer in training. I'm set to graduate from RIT in spring of 2016 with a major in Software Engineering and a minor in Computer Engineering.

From the beginning, I've had a strong appreciation for technology. When I was little, I looked in awe at the things that were built around me and wanted to know how they worked. I could spot a burnt out bulb on a string of lights in seconds, and was more concerned about how things worked than I was concerned about why I was there. That same passion and curiosity followed me to the world of software engineering where I find being involved with building better and more powerful software incredibly exciting.

I’ve worked with technologies from low level languages like Assembly, to filesystems such as ZFS. Offline, I run long distance, explore the outdoors, and enjoy picking up new skills through a variety of side projects. If there’s something new I can learn, I want to learn it.
